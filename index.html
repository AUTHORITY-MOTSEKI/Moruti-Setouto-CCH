<h3>Unforginess</h3>
<p>
First sin thta lead many people to hell it is fornication, then unforgiveness comes after. unforgiveness lead many believers to hell and non-believers <br>alike.
that's why in the Lord's prayer God teach us to forgive one another in the book of <a href="mathhew 6v12-1/index.html"><b>(Mathhew 6v12)</b></a>, it says: "forgive us our debtors as we forgive <br>our debtors". 
it means forgiveness is a two way street, you forgive others first!, then God can forgive you after not the other way around. if you can't <br>forgive others then forget, 
God cannot forgive you too, your prayer will bein vain, and useless, you will be waisting your time and energy <a href="mathhew 6v14-2/index.html"><b>(Matthew 6v14)</b></a>, <br>if you want God to forgive you, you must 
<a href="mark 11v26-3/index.html"><b>(Mark 11v26)</b></a>start first by making peace with everybody. <br><br>
you will hear a born again child of God saying: "who and who i will not forgive them for what they have done to me", some people get hurt and never receive <br>because they 
have chosen to do so <a href="matthew 18v15-4/index.html"><b>(Matthew 18v15)</b></a>. they will continue to say God will forgive them, but really He won't forgive them. hey!, stop deceiving <br>yourself the word of God still 
stand it cannot change to suit us and our feelings. i  like Pastor Samleche when it is time to pray, He declares a prayer of <br>forgiveness of sins to God, you will hear Him saying 
that: "if you know that you have someone that you decided not to forgive in your heart, don't bother to <br>pray this prayer unless you repent and forgive them, if not just keep quite 
while we pray, because you will be waisting your time" <a href="mark 11v25-5/index.html"><b>(Mark 11v25)</b></a>, that's true <br>childrens of God let us learn to forgive one another, just like our God does to us, we sin everyday 
but our God forgive us, He does not count how many but <br>He forgive us. <br> <br>
The offences that we are holding against each other compared to our offences against God are more, we may have been treated badly by someone else, <br>but it does not compare with our 
transgressions against God, forgive no matter what, i know sometimes it might be hard and too difficult to do so. but we <br>are mandated by God to do so by forgiving one another, when you 
start to realize that Jesus deliverd us from eternal death and tormen, we will release others <br>unconditionally. Peter also came to Jesus and ask Him, He said: "Lord, how often shall my 
brother sin against me, and i forgive Him?", and He replied: "I say <br>unto thee, until seven times: but until seventhy times seven" <a href="mathhew 18v21-6/index.html"><b>(Matthew 18v21)</b></a>. This means we must forgive one another 
we should not count how often but we <br>should do so, even if the same person can repeat the very same thing again, we must not remind them of their tresspass to us, but only we should say 
i forgive <br>you, the forgiveness comes from sincere heart, if you have forgiven someone you erase everything they have done to you, in your mind and heart, don't forgive <br>with your mouth, 
but very hard to let go with heart.
</p>
<p>
No matter the valid reason we might have to hate or not to forgive, we must teach our hearts to forgive and forget the tresspasses of other people, your spiritual <br>maturity depends on your willingness 
to forgive and forget past offenses, the word of God says we must love our enemies and bless those who wish evil to us <br><a href="mathhew 5v43&44-8/index.html"><b>(Matthew 5v43-44)</b></a>, even Jesus dith the same He forgave those who were crucifying Him,
let us go to the book of <a href="luke 23v24-7/index.html"><b>(Luke 23v34)</b></a>, it says that,then said Jesus: <br>"Father, forgive them for they know not what they do", Jesus forgave also, He leaded by example, He laid a good foundation for us 
to walk on it, which is to forgive <br>one another. 
</p>
<p>
If jesus, God Himself forgave His murderous, then tell me who are we not to do so, it means this thing of forgiveness is not a joke anymore, it is a must to do, <br>remember Jesus was not just an ordinary person just 
like Stephen or Peter, but He was God Himself, He came here on earth to liberate people from sin and <br>bondages of satan, but the very same people whom Jesus come to rescue, are the ones who crucified Him on the cross, 
but Jesus knew it was not them but <br>demons inside of them, that's why He said: "Father forgive them, for they dont know what they are doing".

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
The bibble says we must have peace with everyone, if not we can't see God <a href="romans 12v18-9/index.html"><b>(Romans 12v18)</b></a>, however 
it is unrighteous for us as a childrens of God <br>to avange ourselves, if you have someone that 
is hard to forgive, no matter how hard you try to, ask help from God, ask Him to help you so that 
you <br>can let go of that person in your heart <a href="proverbs 23v26-10/index.html"><b>(Proverbs 23v26)</b></a>, tell God that you want to forgive 
this person but you find it hard to do so,ask God to remove <br>the blockage in your heart that has been 
caused by unrighteousness, pray for the one who caused that blockage.God will help you, He is so 
sovereign <br>and faithful, the bibble says that the heart that know how to forgive, is more than 
silver and gold with purity, let us excercise our hearts so that they are <br>in a conditions to handle 
offenses and to forgive easily. Do not be one of these people who end up in hell now, because of failure 
to forgive, so, lets us <br>all learn to forgive one another and have peace with everyone <a href="hebrews 12v14-11/index.html"><b>(Hebrews 12v14)</b></a>, 
so God help us to overcome satan and his demons and to forgive <br>one another, stay blessed!!!.
